# Motte

Motte is a tool for extracting information about cases stored on BAILII,
the database of British and Irish legal cases.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'motte'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install motte

## Usage

Motte has a command-line interface which is, for now, the primary way of
interacting with it; you can also use it as a library, though.
